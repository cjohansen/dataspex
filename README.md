# Dataspex

**See the shape of your data.** Dataspex is a point-and-click Clojure(Script)
data browser that lets you peer into maps, vectors, and seqs; trace changes to
atoms over time; explore Datascript connections; and more -- with minimal effort
and a short learning curve.

Dataspex runs as a Chrome and Firefox extension — or as a standalone web app —
and connects to local ClojureScript apps, Clojure REPLs, or across the network
so you can debug apps on your phone.

Whether you're debugging a live system or scrying the hidden structure of your
app state, Dataspex gives you eyes on the flow.

Dataspex is the spiritual successor to [Gadget
Inspector](https://github.com/cjohansen/gadget-inspector).
